BUG LIST -- EECS 448 LAB 7

Victor Berger KUID 2770737


1) the isEmpty() method was not properly implemeted: it will return false on all cases.

2) the size() method was not properly implemeted: it will return the correct value plus 1.

3) the removeFront() method was not properly implemeted: it will remove the back node instead of the front node,
as shown by the following sample case:

    list -> addFront(1)
    
    list -> addBack(2)
    
    list -> removeFront()

The search() method will prove that the element "2" was removed, rather than element "1".
The Tester class returns the following output:

    Searching for values after using removeFront()...
    Value that should have been removed (FRONT) was still found by search()... FAIL.
    Value that should have been kept (BACK) was never found... FAIL.


4) the addBack() method was not properly implemeted: it adds an incorrect value to the back of the list.
